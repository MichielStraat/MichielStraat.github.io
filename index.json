This can be done manually by ophthalmoscopy, which is an effective method of analysing the retina. However, it has been suggested that using fundus photographs is more reliable than ophthalmoscopy. Additionally, these images can be used for automatic identification of the blood vessels, which can be a difficult task due to obstacles such as low contrast with the background, narrow blood vessels and various blood vessel anomalies. A segmentation method with high accuracy can serve as a significant aid in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, as it highlights the blood vessel tree in the fundus. In recent years, several segmentation methods have been proposed for the automatic segmentation of blood vessels, ranging from using cheap and fast trainable filters to complicated neural networks and even deep learning.\n\nIn this paper we discuss and evaluate several of these methods by examining the advantages and disadvantages of each. Subsequently, we take a closer look at a filter-based method called B-COSFIRE. We study the performance of the method on test datasets of fundus images and we examine how the parameter values affect the performance. The performance is measured by comparing the extracted blood vessel tree with a manually segmented blood vessel tree. One of the datasets we consider is the recently published IOSTAR dataset and, if researchers have used the dataset already, we compare our results, using the IOSTAR dataset, with findings about blood vessel segmentation methods on this dataset in the field.\n\nBased on our findings there we discuss when B-COSFIRE is the preferred method to use and in which circumstances could it be beneficial to use a more (computationally) complex segmentation method. We also shortly discuss areas beyond blood vessel segmentation where these methods can be used to segment elongated structures, such as rivers in satellite images or nerves of a leave.\n","tags":[],"title":"Segmentation of blood vessels in retinal fundus images","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548887280,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548887280,"objectID":"d98a4042249428a65ab22eb8f86e64b4","permalink":"https://michielstraat.com/talk/mastertalk/","publishdate":"2019-01-30T23:28:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/mastertalk/","section":"talk","summary":"The rectifier activation function (Rectified Linear Unit: ReLU) has become popular in deep learning applications, mostly because the activation function often yields better performance than sigmoidal activation functions. Although there are known advantages of using ReLU, there is still a lack of mathematical arguments that explain why ReLU networks have the ability to learn faster and show better performance. In this project, the Statistical Physics of Learning framework is used to derive an exact mathematical description of the learning dynamics of the ReLU perceptron and ReLU Soft Committee Machines. The mathematical description consists of a system of ordinary differential equations that describe the evolution of so-called order parameters, which summarize the state of the network relative to the target rule. The correctness of the theoretical results is verified with simulations and several learning scenarios will be discussed.","tags":[],"title":"On-line learning in neural networks with ReLU activations","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548886037,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548886037,"objectID":"5dfa8fcdeb3ba6e78c1f18f06eba5979","permalink":"https://michielstraat.com/talk/wsom2017/","publishdate":"2019-01-30T23:07:17+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/wsom2017/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Prototypes and matrix relevance learning in complex Fourier space","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Michiel Straat","Michael Biehl"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546297200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546297200,"objectID":"553234aebaf4971c937e60d3d5edd13a","permalink":"https://michielstraat.com/publication/esann-2019/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/esann-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce exact macroscopic on-line learning dynamics of two-layer neural networks with ReLU units in the form of a system of differential equations, using techniques borrowed from statistical physics.

We exemplify the approach in terms of two specific model situations: In the first, we consider the learning of a classification scheme from clustered data by means of prototype-based Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ). In the second, we study the training of layered neural networks with sigmoidal activations for the purpose of regression. In both cases, the target, i.e., the classification or regression scheme, is considered to change continuously while the system is trained from a stream of labeled data. We extend and apply methods borrowed from statistical physics which have been used frequently for the exact description of training dynamics in stationary environments. Extensions of the approach allow for the computation of typical learning curves in the presence of concept drift in a variety of model situations. First results are presented and discussed for stochastic drift processes in classification and regression problems. They indicate that LVQ is capable of tracking a classification scheme under drift to a non-trivial extent. Furthermore, we show that concept drift can cause the persistence of sub-optimal plateau states in gradient based training of layered neural networks for regression.","tags":null,"title":"Statistical Mechanics of On-Line Learning Under Concept Drift","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michiel Straat","Marika Kaden","Matthias Gay","Thomas Villmann","Alexander Lampe","Udo Seiffert","Michael Biehl","Friedrich Melchert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498860000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498860000,"objectID":"4ef613bb0c085fbbb152985740ff2e94","permalink":"https://michielstraat.com/publication/wsom-2017/","publishdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/wsom-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"In this contribution, we consider the classification of time-series and similar functional data which can be represented in complex Fourier coefficient space.
