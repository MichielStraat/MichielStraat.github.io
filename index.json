This can be done manually by ophthalmoscopy, which is an effective method of analysing the retina. However, it has been suggested that using fundus photographs is more reliable than ophthalmoscopy. Additionally, these images can be used for automatic identification of the blood vessels, which can be a difficult task due to obstacles such as low contrast with the background, narrow blood vessels and various blood vessel anomalies. A segmentation method with high accuracy can serve as a significant aid in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, as it highlights the blood vessel tree in the fundus. In recent years, several segmentation methods have been proposed for the automatic segmentation of blood vessels, ranging from using cheap and fast trainable filters to complicated neural networks and even deep learning.\n\nIn this paper we discuss and evaluate several of these methods by examining the advantages and disadvantages of each. Subsequently, we take a closer look at a filter-based method called B-COSFIRE. We study the performance of the method on test datasets of fundus images and we examine how the parameter values affect the performance. The performance is measured by comparing the extracted blood vessel tree with a manually segmented blood vessel tree. One of the datasets we consider is the recently published IOSTAR dataset and, if researchers have used the dataset already, we compare our results, using the IOSTAR dataset, with findings about blood vessel segmentation methods on this dataset in the field.\n\nBased on our findings there we discuss when B-COSFIRE is the preferred method to use and in which circumstances could it be beneficial to use a more (computationally) complex segmentation method. We also shortly discuss areas beyond blood vessel segmentation where these methods can be used to segment elongated structures, such as rivers in satellite images or nerves of a leave.\n","tags":[],"title":"Segmentation of blood vessels in retinal fundus images","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548887280,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548887280,"objectID":"d98a4042249428a65ab22eb8f86e64b4","permalink":"https://michielstraat.com/talk/mastertalk/","publishdate":"2019-01-30T23:28:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/mastertalk/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"On-line learning in neural networks with ReLU activations","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548886037,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548886037,"objectID":"5dfa8fcdeb3ba6e78c1f18f06eba5979","permalink":"https://michielstraat.com/talk/wsom2017/","publishdate":"2019-01-30T23:07:17+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/wsom2017/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Prototypes and matrix relevance learning in complex Fourier space","type":"talk"},{"authors":["M.

We exemplify the approach in terms of two specific model situations: In the first, we consider the learning of a classification scheme from clustered data by means of prototype-based Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ). In the second, we study the training of layered neural networks with sigmoidal activations for the purpose of regression. In both cases, the target, i.e., the classification or regression scheme, is considered to change continuously while the system is trained from a stream of labeled data. We extend and apply methods borrowed from statistical physics which have been used frequently for the exact description of training dynamics in stationary environments. Extensions of the approach allow for the computation of typical learning curves in the presence of concept drift in a variety of model situations. First results are presented and discussed for stochastic drift processes in classification and regression problems. They indicate that LVQ is capable of tracking a classification scheme under drift to a non-trivial extent. Furthermore, we show that concept drift can cause the persistence of sub-optimal plateau states in gradient based training of layered neural networks for regression.","tags":null,"title":"Statistical Mechanics of On-Line Learning Under Concept Drift","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

We apply versions of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) which are suitable for complex-valued data, based on the so-called Wirtinger calculus. It makes possible the formulation of gradient based update rules in the framework of cost-function based Generalized Matrix Relevance LVQ (GMLVQ). Alternatively, we consider the concatenation of real and imaginary parts of Fourier coefficients in a real-valued feature vector and the classification of time domain representations by means of conventional GMLVQ.","tags":null,"title":"Prototypes and matrix relevance learning in complex fourier space","type":"publication"}]
